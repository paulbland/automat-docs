Hi everyone, I’m Paul.

Over the past few months, I’ve been building a new tool for filmmakers called Automat Studio.

It’s designed to help you visualize your film before you shoot. You can create characters, define locations, plan scenes, and generate images or video to explore your concept early in the process.

Whether you’re a writer, director, or anyone working on a film, Automat Studio offers a way to develop and refine your ideas.

The public beta is now live. If you’re curious, you’re welcome to join the waitlist and take a look.
