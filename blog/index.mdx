**Automat Studio is structured around the traditional filmmaking process.**

We’ve designed Automat Studio to reflect the roles of an actual film production. Character Studio is your casting department. Location Studio handles locations and set decoration. Aesthetics covers cinematography. Shot Creator lets the director compose the frame. More departments are coming soon.

Filmmaking has always been a collaborative craft. With Automat Studio, we’re preserving that structure — while making it easier to experiment, iterate, and bring your vision to life.

If you know how films are made, Automat Studio will feel familiar. It’s built on the same creative foundations.

**Automat Studio doesn’t generate ideas—you do.**

The artist is always in control. Behind the scenes, our vision is made possible by new generative AI technologies. But we firmly believe AI’s purpose is not to replace human creativity.

Creativity is the responsibility of the artist, and great filmmaking will always need a human spark. Automat Studio is a new tool to help bring your vision to life—your characters, your locations, your scenes. The story is always yours.

**Welcome to Automat Studio.**

Hi everyone, I’m Paul.

Over the past few months, I’ve been building a new tool for filmmakers called Automat Studio.

It’s designed to help you visualize your film before you shoot. You can create characters, define locations, plan scenes, and generate images or video to explore your concept early in the process.

Whether you’re a writer, director, or anyone working on a film, Automat Studio offers a way to develop and refine your ideas.

The public beta is now live. If you’re curious, you’re welcome to join the waitlist and take a look.
