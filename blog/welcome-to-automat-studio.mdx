Hi everyone, my name’s Paul. Over the past few months I’ve been quietly building a new tool for filmmakers. I’m calling to Automat Studio. 

Automat Studio is a tool designed to help you visualize your film. Before you ever pick up a camera, it allows you to create characters, define locations, plan scenes, and generate images or video to explore your film concept.

Whether you’re a writer, director, cinematographer or anyone who’s ever had an idea for a film, Automat Studio allows to bring your concept to life.

Automat Studio is in early access now. If you’re curious, join the waitlist and help us shape the future of Automat Studio and help bring this tool to filmmakers around the world.
