Traditional filmmaking model

🎬 Automat follows a filmmaking model that’s as old as cinema itself.

Start with your characters.
Place them in locations.
Build out scenes, shots, and visual ideas with real cinematic language — one day, we’ll add wardrobe, props, maybe even blocking and lighting plans.

This isn’t prompt-magic or “make me a movie.”
It’s a creative tool built on the same building blocks filmmakers have always used.

If you know how films are made, Automat will feel familiar — just faster, more flexible, and endlessly visual.

A tool for those who love the craft.
