The artist is always in control

Automat Studi is an artist-led, hands-on tool for narrative filmmakers.

Under the hood, Automat Studio’s vision is made possible new generative AI technologies. But we firmly believe AI
Is not to generate idea. That’s solely the responsibility of the artist, and will always need a human touch. 

Automat studio uses these technologies to  help you visualize what’s already in your head. Characters, locations, scenes — come to life so you can see your story evolve before you shoot.

This is a tool that serves your vision, not the other way around. The artist is always in control.
