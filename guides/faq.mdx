## Can Automat really make a film?

_Not yet — but it gets you close._

Automat doesn’t create full films (for now), but it’s a powerful tool for developing ideas visually. You can build characters and locations, iterate on new concepts, experiment with shots and styles, and create something like a living storyboard. It brings your imagination to life and helps you shape the early stages of a film.

As generative AI improves, so will Automat. You’ll be able to return to existing projects and regenerate visuals using the latest technology — evolving your film alongside the tools.

## How do I leave feedback?

Click the _speech bubble icon_ on the left-hand menu. We’d love to hear your thoughts — what works, what’s missing, or what you’d love to see added.

## Can I add sound to a shot?

_Not yet._

Right now, Automat only generates the video portion of a shot. But we’re actively working on adding support for dialogue, sound effects, and music in future updates.
